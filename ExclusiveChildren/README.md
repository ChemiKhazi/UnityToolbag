Exclusive Children
===

This simple component/editor pair allows you to easily work with game objects that are exclusive views. A couple places this might be useful are:

- On a parent game object that contains multiple menus for your main menu
- On an in-game UI game object that contains your different UI panes

The script is primarily just an editor tool. The component will display a set of buttons, one for each child of the object. Clicking any button will enable that object and disable all others.
