Draw Title Safe Area
===

This script helps debug games for TVs (i.e. Ouya or other console) by rendering the title safe area guides on top of the scene. It draws a red border in the outside 10% of the screen and a yellow border in the outside 10-20%. All your game's action should be inside the red border and all your game's vital UI and text should be inside the yellow border.

The opacity of the border is adjustable so you can make it work for your needs and of course you can dynamically toggle the component on and off as needed.
