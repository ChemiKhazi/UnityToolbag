Sprite UI Fill
====

A shader and script that replicates the radial filled image type available in the Unity UI. Useful for creating world based UI elements that don't interfere with mouse clicks and without the need for a world space UI panel.

----

1. Create a new material that uses the "Sprite/Radial Fill" shader.
2. Apply the "Sprite/Radial Fill" material to SpriteRenderers that will use a radial fill.
3. Attach the SpriteRadialFill script to the SpriteRenderer.
