PolyMesh
========

Create 2D shapes in an instant with the PolyMesh editor! Right in Unity you can create polygons, add, split, extrude, and move around vertices to build the shape you want. If straight edges aren’t good enough, connect vertices with curves to get nice smooth shapes. Great for developing 2D games, quick prototyping, or even just creating odd-shaped colliders!
